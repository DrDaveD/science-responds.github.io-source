# COVID-19 ML and Tech Related Open Science Projects

## Context:

This document is a place to collect details on open science/open source technology based projects related to COVID-19. This includes modeling, public health interventions, medical technology, resource distribution, and more. Please feel free to add your own project or other projects that you know of! We just ask that you keep the doc organized and follow the format below:

Project Title
Description: A brief description of the project
Resources: Links to important info about the project (include related articles if possible!)
Looking for: What kind of folks can best contribute to this project?
How to get involved: Include links to sign up forms, GitHub issues, Slack channels, etc

Let’s make the most of our work from home time and try to help our fellow humans (and maybe learn some new skills!). 

## Projects

*CORD19 Data Set*
*Description:* This open dataset is supported by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Microsoft Research, The Allen Institute for AI, The NIH Library of Medicine, Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, and Kaggle AI. CORD-19 is a resource of over 29,000 scholarly articles, including over 13,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. The dataset represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for data and text mining to date and is updated as new research is published in peer-reviewed publications and archival services.
