# COVID-19 ML and Tech Related Open Science Projects

## Context

This document is a place to collect details on open science/open source technology based projects related to COVID-19. This includes modeling, public health interventions, medical technology, resource distribution, and more. Please feel free to add your own project or other projects that you know of! We just ask that you keep the doc organized and follow the format below:

Project Title
Description: A brief description of the project
Resources: Links to important info about the project (include related articles if possible!)
Looking for: What kind of folks can best contribute to this project?
How to get involved: Include links to sign up forms, GitHub issues, Slack channels, etc

Let’s make the most of our work from home time and try to help our fellow humans (and maybe learn some new skills!). 

To reach out to the doc creator, please email savannah.thais@gmail.com.

## Projects

### CORD19 Data Set

**Description:** This open dataset is supported by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, Microsoft Research, The Allen Institute for AI, The NIH Library of Medicine, Georgetown’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, Cold Spring Harbor Lab, and Kaggle AI. CORD-19 is a resource of over 29,000 scholarly articles, including over 13,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses. This freely available dataset is provided to the global research community to apply recent advances in natural language processing and other AI techniques to generate new insights in support of the ongoing fight against this infectious disease. The dataset represents the most extensive machine-readable coronavirus literature collection available for data and text mining to date and is updated as new research is published in peer-reviewed publications and archival services.

  * Whitehouse [Call to Action](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/call-action-tech-community-new-machine-readable-covid-19-dataset/)

**Looking for:** Researchers familiar with NLP-based ML and AI methods.

**How to get involved:** 
Form a team (or go solo) and submit to the Kaggle Challenge (see [Initial Key Questions](https://www.kaggle.com/allen-institute-for-ai/CORD-19-research-challenge/tasks))

### Johns Hopkins Mapping nCOV Project

**Description:** This team has developed an [interactive web-based dashboard](https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6) hosted by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, to visualize and track reported cases in real-time. The dashboard illustrates the location and number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries for all affected countries. It was developed to provide researchers, public health authorities and the general public with a user-friendly tool to track the outbreak as it unfolds. Additionally, the data (which is verified and updated daily) is available on GitHub. They are interested in conducting additional modeling of the emerging outbreak.

  * Related [Kaggle challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset)
  * Dashboards built on their dataset, using GitHub Actions: [covid19dashboards](http://covid19dashboards.com/), built on [fastai/fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)

**Looking for:** It doesn’t explicitly say on the website, but presumably ML researchers, model-builders, data visualization folks, data scientists

**How to get involved:**
  * Reach out to the group at COVID19map@jhu.edu or jhusystems@gmail.com
  * Grab the data and build your own project

### Project Open Air (Just One Giant Lab)

**Description:** Project Open Air/Helpful Engineers, hosted within the broader open science group Just One Giant Lab has created a 5,000 strong volunteer organization, with engineers, scientists and doctors around the world who work to organize themselves into teams to design innovative ways to fight the virus. They are quickly trying to design and arrange the production of pragmatic devices to move life-saving air, extend existing tools, or organize volunteers on the ground to bolster medical workers. They have both hardware and software based projects including designing open source, scalable easy to DIY ventilators and O2 concentrators, sentiment analysis for persuasive public health media, diagnostic apps, and more!

**Resources:**
  * Project [homepage](https://app.jogl.io/project/121#about)
  * Google [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qtQlHXeLzfgIWJPnlad803tzfmr0Z_7_) with project documents
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/Helpful-Engineers/resources) for the software projects

**Looking for:** MANY different skills sets: app developers, ML researchers, data scientists, data visualization folks, makers, fabricators, designers, organizers, and especially folks who can volunteer time for project management.
