# Computing resources

  A number of scientific computing and data resources are prioritizing 
and/or calling proposals on COVID19 research. Some can also enable 

  * U.S. COVID-19 HPC Consortium - [website](https://www.ibm.com/covid19/hpc-consortium)
    * XSEDE Resource Allocations System (XRAS) - [Preparing a COVID-19 HPC Consortium Request](https://www.xsede.org/covid19-hpc-consortium)

  * Open Science Grid - [website](https://opensciencegrid.org/)
    * Nominally part of XRAS above, but requests still being sorted out
    * Can help those who already share - or want to share - research computing capacity that their local institutions via OSG, and also to prioritize COVID-19 research
    * For both contact them directly for now: [help@opensciencegrid.org](mailto:help@opensciencegrid.org)

  * WLCG
    * TBD

  * CERN
    * TBD

  * PRACE
    * [Fast Track Call for Proposals](https://prace-ri.eu/prace-support-to-mitigate-impact-of-covid-19-pandemic/)

  * Folding at Home
    * Volunteer computing for protein folding
    * See the links in the [project description](https://science-responds.org/projects/ds#fah) on this website
