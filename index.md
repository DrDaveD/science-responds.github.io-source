## The Larger Scientific Community Responds to the COVID19 Pandemic

The coronavirus continues to spread around the world and risks
overwhelming the health systems in many countries. We hope that you
are all well and are taking the necessary steps to protect yourselves,
your families and your colleagues.

The virus is having enormous direct health impacts on our society as well 
as other major indirect social and economic impacts. The full scientific 
research community and its rich set of tools are key to responding to 
these challenges. This website has been set up to:

  1. Make connections to enable (non-medical) researchers to contribute to understanding and combating this global problem and/or its economic and societal impacts. This includes in particular ways in which researchers with significant data analytics, machine learning, simulation, software, computing, and organizational skills can contribute, as well as places where marshaling large "Big Science"-style distributed teams to tackle problems can be useful.

  2. Explore how all types of research activities can adapt and be effective in an era in which face-to-face meetings and travel are greatly reduced and conferences are being canceled.

If you are interested in either of these topics, please join the Slack discussions, explore this website and find ways to make contributions!
