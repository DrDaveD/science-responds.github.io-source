## The Larger Scientific Community Responds to the COVID19 Pandemic

The coronavirus continues to spread around the world and risks
overwhelming the health systems in many countries. We hope that you
are all well and are taking the necessary steps to protect yourselves,
your families and your colleagues.

The virus is having enormous direct health impacts on our society as well 
as other major indirect social and economic impacts. The full scientific 
research community and its rich set of tools are key to responding to 
these challenges. 
We are a group of non-medical researchers from various "Big Science" and
computational fields. Our researchers have significant data analytics, 
simulation, software, computing, and organizational skills, and "Big Science" 
projects are also successful at marshaling large, distributed teams to 
tackle problems.

This website is meant to facilitate answering two questions:

   * Are there ways in which (non-medical) researchers can contribute to understanding and combating this global problem and its economic and societal impacts?
   * How can all types of research activities adapt and be effective in an era in which face-to-face meetings and travel are greatly reduced and conferences are being canceled?
